<h1>About me</h1>
<p> Hi! I am Esther. I am a christian which means that I have accepted Jesus in my life. I love web builing and I am the one who made this webpage! I live in Africa,Kenya. Kenya is a wonderful place to visit, It has elephants, the rare white rhino, majestic mountains, waterfalls, beaches and many more. I like hiking on hills and mountains. I hiked on Mount Longonot located here in Kenya. I also hiked on the Seven Ngong hills which is also located in Kenya. I play the piano at home, my sister plays the guitar and the flute though she is not really good at them. I can play some chords and alot of songs. My sisters and I sometimes think that maybe one day we might become a musical family. Coding, I love coding so much that I have already created 5 websites. I am a student and Udemy, thats where I learn how to create web pages! </p>
